# Summary

B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, M.S in Computer Science.  Mechanical engineer/software engineer looking for next opportunity.  Extremely skilled in tooling design, design-for-manufacturability, and design-for-injection-molding.  Certified SolidWorks Expert.

# Professional Experience

## FLASHPOINT, Senior Software Engineer

*(Junior: Mar 2022 \- Sept 2023, Senior: 2023 \- Present)*

* Develop internal tooling to empower my team and increase their productivity: slackbots, web UI’s for interfacing with complex systems more easily, command-line scripts to automate tedious processes.  
* Developed dozens of standalone web scraping applications (and supporting libraries) for dark-web data collection.  
* Maintained a system that parsed and processed millions of web documents per day, and expanded it to allow my team to add plugins for quick and effective extension of the service.  
* Led 3-4 projects/year, budgeting, planning, coordinating dependencies, keeping teammates unblocked and managers up to date, while delivering high-quality software for clients on time.

## PROTOQUICK, Lead Engineer, Project Manager, Quality Manager

*(Oct 2015 \- Jan 2022)*

* Provide DFM support for molding and machining projects to customers in a wide variety of fields.  Update and modify their CAD files for them as needed.  
* Design injection molding tools for prototype and production use, and manage each project from initial customer RFQ through to tool validation.  
* Grow customer base by creating and maintaining an ISO 9001- and ISO 13485-compliant quality system required by large medical companies.  
* Inspect parts using traditional metrology equipment as well as optical and touch-probe CNC equipment.  Program automated inspections and generate inspection reports.  
* Lead, train, and mentor engineers and quality technicians to maintain well-crafted and functional designs.  
* Work closely with customers to ensure their parts are as manufacturable as possible while still meeting their functional requirements.  Provide quotes based on timeline, tolerance, material, and quantity needs.  
* Work closely with vendors to help customers select materials and processes that best align with their goals.  Request quotes from vendors and generate orders.

## SMI, Mechanical Engineer

*(June 2014 \- Oct 2015)*

* Saved over 100 hours/year of engineering time by replacing a manual, Excel-driven process with a Python analysis program that interfaced with a NIST FORTRAN library.  
* Perform design calculations, build models of compressor and turbine parts and full assemblies, generate drawings using both SolidWorks and AutoCAD for vendors, inspect finished components, and assemble finished systems.  
* Organized, catalogued, and implemented searchability of hundreds of often-referenced hardcopy technical drawings with a custom MS Access front end to a SQL database.  
* Wrote a book of training documentation for the company’s ANSYS turbomachinery processes.  Went from beginner to functional expert and complete training manual in under a year.
