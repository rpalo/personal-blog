## About Me

I'm a mechanical engineer and tool designer.  Mostly molds for injection molding medical devices.  It's pretty cool!  I'm also the quality manager and tooling project manager.

I love to code (hence: blog).  Python, Ruby, Bash, and Rust mostly.  And dabbling in a bunch of other stuff.

I've got my Master's in Computer Science with a focus on intelligent systems: data science, AI, robotics, and security/forensics.  My thesis was building a AI scheduler for molding jobs at my current company, effectively solving a domain-specific version of the Job Shop Problem, and it worked out really well!  Write up/link to project coming soon.

I'm actively searching for my first dev job.  [Here's a copy of my dev resume.](/6-21-resume.pdf)  I think I'd do best at a back-end, SysDevOps, SRE, documentation, or internal tooling position.  I *am* a toolmaker, after all.  Preferably with lots of mentorship.

That being said, I'm really open to anything and I'm confident that I'd be productive and a great hire for pretty much any position and language.  I love learning new things, so I'm always excited to dig into a new language or framework.  

Remote or Sacramento area preferred.
