Hi!  My name is Ryan Palo.  I'm a mechanical engineer in the Sacramento, CA area.  Here's how to get in touch with me:

The quickest, easiest, most reliable way is definitely email.  You can reach me at hello@assertnotmagic.com or ryan@thepalos.com.

## About Me

I'm a mechanical engineer and tool designer.  Mostly molds for injection molding medical devices.  It's pretty cool!  I'm also the quality manager and tooling project manager.

I love to code (hence: blog).  Python, Ruby, Bash, and Rust mostly.  And dabbling in a bunch of other stuff.

I'm finishing up my Master's in Computer Science (expected June of 2021) with a focus on intelligent systems: data science, AI, robotics, and security/forensics.

I'm actively searching for my first dev job.  [Here's a copy of my dev resume.](/07-20-resume.pdf)  I think I'd do best at a back-end, SysDevOps, SRE, documentation, or internal tooling position.  I *am* a toolmaker, after all.  Preferably with lots of mentorship.

That being said, I'm really open to anything and I'm confident that I'd be productive and a great hire for pretty much any position and language.  I love learning new things, so I'm always excited to dig into a new language or framework.  

Remote or Sacramento area preferred.
