## About Me

I'm currently a senior software engineer at Flashpoint, working on the data collection team.  Before that, I was a mechanical engineer, tool designer, quality manager, and project manager at ProtoQuick, a medical injection molding company.

I love to code!  Python, Rust, and Go mostly.  And dabbling in a bunch of other stuff.

I've got my Master's in Computer Science with a focus on intelligent systems: data science, AI, robotics, and security/forensics.  My thesis was building a AI scheduler for molding jobs at my current company, effectively solving a domain-specific version of the Job Shop Problem, and it worked out really well!

I'm always open to possible new work and contract work (both software and mechanical design).  Here are copies of my [software resume](/resume/software) and my [mechanical resume](/resume/mechanical).  I prefer back-end, Sys/Dev Ops, SRE, or other server related work.  I *am* a toolmaker, after all.  That being said, I also really enjoy front-end development.  As long as there's plenty of opportunity to learn and grow.  Remote or Sacramento area preferred.
