# Summary

I am a Senior Software Engineer with a Master’s in CS and a dual software and mechanical engineering background looking for my next career move.

I’ve worked primarily in Python as project lead, contributor, maintainer, on numerous large-scale and production-critical projects on both the front- and back-end.  I’m driven by opportunities to learn.  I’m confident working in and leading engineering teams to get projects from requirements to production and keeping them running in good health for their entire life-cycle.  I typically work autonomously with minimal supervision.  I’m a technical writer and named technical editor on multiple software books.  I love to mentor and train other developers.

# Professional Experience

## FLASHPOINT, Senior Software Engineer

*(Junior: Mar 2022 - Sept 2023, Senior: Sept 2023 - Present)*

* Converted an internal legacy Kubernetes workload management system driven by an unsynchronized, per-user CLI tool to a centralized service API backed by FastAPI \+ Postgres with a CLI client as well as a React \+ Typescript UI client option, saving hours of onboarding time and maintenance burden.  I continue to develop and add new features and maintain this service.  
* Built and integrated a Slack-bot into the above service so that non-technical internal users could create new workloads based on customer requests by typing a chat message, streamlining our delivery process and freeing up our developers from time-consuming automatable tasks.  
* Proposed and led the project to revamp a legacy data parsing system based on a custom JSON-as-code solution, converting it to a more modular and easy to use Python-based system, increasing performance and reducing maintenance burden, while maintaining and improving performance in a system that processes millions of documents per day.

## PROTOQUICK, Lead Mech. Eng., Project Manager, Quality Manager

*(Oct 2015 \- Jan 2022)*

* Increased requests for quote by 25% year/year by building new company website and incorporating serverless file-upload and quoting forms (Jekyll, JavaScript, CSS Grid, Serverless Form/File-Upload Services).  
* Doubled project completion rate by increasing scheduling, visibility, and productivity.  
* Grow customer base by creating and maintaining an ISO 9001-compliant documentation and quality system required by most large medical companies.  
* Led, trained, and mentored engineers and quality technicians to maintain well-crafted and validated designs and expand throughput.

## SMI, Mechanical Engineer

*(June 2014 \- Oct 2015)*

* Saved over 100 hours/year of engineering time by replacing a manual, Excel-driven process with a Python analysis program that interfaced with a NIST FORTRAN library.  
* Increased sales by building and releasing a lead generation app.  Went from zero knowledge of mobile app development to a released application in 3 months.  
* Organized, catalogued, and implemented searchability of hundreds of often-referenced hardcopy technical drawings with a custom MS Access front end to a SQL database.  
* Wrote a book of training documentation for the company’s numerical fluid analysis software.  Went from zero knowledge to functional expert and complete training manual in under a year.
