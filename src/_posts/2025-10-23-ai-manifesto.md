After seeing an example on
<a href="https://cassidoo.co/ai/" rel="external">cassidoo's site</a>, I decided
to add an ["AI Transparency" page](/ai) to my site as well.

Both she and <a href="https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto" rel="external">the
post she links</a> make a really good point about how, if a person or company is
transparent about how they use AI, it helps us trust that their work is more
authentic in general. They recommend adding a page to your site (e.g. `/ai`)
that details how you make use of generative AI (or not). From the simplest "No
posts on this site are written with generative AI," to a longer, more detailed
breakdown, the idea is not to cover your bases with legalese, but to be
authentic, clear, and real. It's not a bad thing to use AI, necessarily. It's a
tool like any other, and a user needs to understand how it works--pro's, con's,
strengths, and dangers. But it's good to be open about it to help people
understand and gain context for your work.

And if you _do_ decide to add one to your site, you can add your site to this
<a href="https://slashai.page/" rel="external">public database of /ai
page-having sites</a>!
